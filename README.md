## 1. 3D Mathematical Objects 🎨
- Implement a menu-driven program to create various 3D mathematical objects:
  - I. Curve
  - II. Sphere
  - III. Cone
  - IV. Arrow
  - V. Ring
  - VI. Cylinder

## 2. Histogram of Integers 📊
- Write a program to read 'n' integers and display them as a histogram.

## 3. Curves Display 📈
- Display sine, cosine, polynomial, and exponential curves.

## 4. Pulse Rate vs. Height Graph ❤️‍🔥
- Plot a graph of people with pulse rate 'p' vs. height 'h'. User inputs values of 'p' and 'h'.

## 5. Chemical Reaction Mass Calculation ⚗️
- Calculate the mass 'm' in a chemical reaction using the formula: `m = 60 / (t + 2)`. Plot a graph for 't' vs. 'm' where 't' >= 0.

## 6. Bacterial Population Growth 🦠
- Simulate the growth of a bacterial population using the formula: `P(t) = (15000 * (1 + t)) / (15 + e)`. Plot a graph for 'P' vs. 't' for a specified time interval.

## 7. Equations of Motion 🏃‍♂️📉
- Input initial velocity and acceleration, and plot the following graphs depicting equations of motion:
  - I. Velocity vs. time (`v = u + at`)
  - II. Distance vs. time (`s = ut + 0.5at^2`)
  - III. Distance vs. velocity (`s = (v^2 - u^2) / (2a)`)
